              is an application that facilitates aging in place by monitoring patient activity and vitals in order to
              automate actions within their home, establish a link between patient and caregiver, and provide data
              visualizations of the aging patient directly to the caregiver. It will alert the caregiver if the patient

            What We Learned<br />Designing for the elderly user requires compassion and strong attention to detail. We
            had to change our design perspective to accommodate for their needs, in terms of color, size, motion, and
            functionality.<br />We learned the importance of the role of the caregiver, and what specific aspects of
            elderly care they struggle with the most.<br />Takeaways<br />We’ve received so much feedback from friends
            and family expressing how much they want and need a product like this. People have told us that they wish
            they could use our product right now, or how they wish they could’ve had this product for a family
            member.<br />As a group we’ve become more compassionate through designs, and this project has shown us that
            the end user is ultimately always the highest priority.<br />Opportunities For Growth<br />Increased
            accessibility features and settings<br />Accommodations for Alzheimer&#39;s care<br />Support for devices
